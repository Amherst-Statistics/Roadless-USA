# Roadless-USA
Teaching materials for the Roadless-USA activity

This lesson asks students to sample random latitude and longitude coordinates from the contiguous United States, display these locations on a map, and then determine whether or not the point is within one mile of a road. Students utilize this sampling method to estimate an unknown parameter (the proportion of the continental United States within one mile of a road). The question of how much of the United States lies within one mile of a road provides an interesting context for statistics education because roads have an ecological impact on the surrounding environment (Murphy, 2013; USGS, 2005).

Students use software to generate a set of samples, display each of these locations on a Google map with a circle of radius 1 mile centered at each point, and record relevant information about each location.

These data are used to calculate an estimate of the proportion of the continental United States within one mile of a road and a 95% confidence interval from the studentsâ€™ samples of locations (generally each pair of students can collect about 20 in a class period). Each pair of students can also share their number of successes out of the total number of observations that fell within the contiguous United States. The teacher can then tally the class collective number of successes out of all observations within the contiguous United States and calculate the class-wide estimate of the proportion of the entire United States within one mile of a road (and associated 95% confidence interval for this parameter).

Students observe how an innovative sampling method can shed light on an interesting question and demonstrate the impact that sample size has on the width of the confidence interval.
